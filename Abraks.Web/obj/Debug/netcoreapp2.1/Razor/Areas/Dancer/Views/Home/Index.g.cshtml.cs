                Many Bulgarian dances are line dances, with the dancers holding hands in a straight or curved line,
                facing in toward the center of the dance space. Originally men and women danced in separate lines, or in
                a gender-segregated line in which the last woman and first man held opposite ends of a handkerchief, to
                avoid gender contact, but today men and women often dance in mixed lines. Several different handholds are

                Bulgarian dances are distinctive for their subtle rhythms and intricate footwork. In some dances, the dancers repeat the same
                pattern of steps throughout the dance, while others are ""called"" dances with several different steps in which the leader calls

                points with variations like stamps and foot slaps.

                In dances in which the line moves to the right or left, the dancer at the head of the
                line is the ""leader"". It is his responsibility to lead the line so it doesn't collide with
                other lines, and in ""called"" dances to call the variations. New dancers joining a dancing
                line join at the end; it is bad manners to join at the head of the line, in front of the leader.
